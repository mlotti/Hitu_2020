    "In this exercise we will get familiar with leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO) simulation. As you might know, beyond the tree level things can get messy. The NLO Feynman diagrams (diagrams with one loop) need to be taken into account and for instance the cross section calculation becomes harder. The NLO diagrams influence the experimental results as well. \n",

    "Your task this week is to analyse two datasets. One is a ttbar process (any process that produces a top quark and an anti-top quark) simulated in LO and the other is a ttbar process in NLO. These simulations have been made in the framework of CMS detector by following the circumstances of 2016 data taking. This means that we are looking at proton-proton collisions with $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV center-of-mass energy. \n",

    "In the normalisation use need to know the theoretical cross section of the process. We assume the mass of the top quark to be 172.5 GeV.\n",
    "The latest calculated theoretical cross section is then 831.76 pb.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise we are studying jets. Jets are collimated sprays of hadrons. Since the lifetime of a top quark is very short, it decays into a jet which is then measured. The difference of LO and NLO can be seen for instance in the jet distributions.\n",

    "We have so far used csv files in our studies. In particle physics however we use quite a lot of .root files. Therefore we will get familiar with .root files in this exercise as well. Below is an example of how to read and loop over the data. Note that the data is nested. Each particle collision event may create multiple jets. To find the data for each jet separately one must have two nested loops, one looping over the events and the other looping through the jets of the event.\n",

The easiest way to do this is to realize that an exponential curve is just a straight line after taking a logarithm. Therefore you can take the logarithm of bin heights and fit a straight line $ax+b$ to them using [numpy.polyfit](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.polyfit.html) (fitting polynomials is in general quite easy and much less frustrating than arbitrary functions). The exponential curve is then $e^be^{ax}$. Check that the curve fits reasonably well to the data. Return the parameters $a$ and $b$ (do NOT return $e^b$ by accident)."
