    "Helsinki Institute of Physics is involved in a search for charged Higgs bosons in the CMS collaboration. If one adds a second scalar doublet to the standard model, we get in total five physical Higgs bosons. Three of them are neutral and two have an electrical charge. Models predicting these bosons are called *two-Higgs-doublet models* and they are the first step towards for instance supersymmetry and therefore an observation of a charged Higgs boson would be clear evidence of Beyond the Standard Model theories. \n",

    "- Charged Higgs boson signal sample\n",
    "- W + jet background sample \n",

    "When searching for new particles, we need to impose cuts to data to increase the signal over background ratio. Signal over background ratio tells us how much signal and background we have after a cut. In other words when we impose a cut, we usually cut background but also some signal. We want to make sure that every cut takes a small amount of signal away and a large amount of background away. \n",
    "\n",
    "The helicity of tau leptons carries information about their origin, so it provides a useful handle for discrimination between the tau leptons originating from charged Higgs boson decays and those originating from a W decays. Therefore, we will use a variable called R_tau to discriminate between the signal and the background in this exercise. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neutrinos are always left-handed in the Standard Model. Tau leptons produced in a charged Higgs bosons decay are therefore always right-handed since a charged Higgs boson is a scalar particle. On the other hand (pun intended), when a vector boson W decays into a tau lepton, the tau lepton is forced to be left-handed since the neutrino is left-handed. It turns out that this influences the kinematics of the tau lepton decay. An emission of the leading track particle is more likely to be towards the tau lepton's direction of movement for the right-handed tau. Therefore in laboratory coordinates the leading tracks originally caused by the decay of the charged Higgs boson have on average a larger momentum than the ones caused by the decay of the W boson.\n",
    "\n",
    "R_tau is defined as the the leading track pT of a tau lepton divided by the pT of the tau lepton.\n",

    "This week's task is to find an optimal value for the R_tau that cuts the background without taking too much of the signal away. Check Moodle which files for Hplus and Wjet you should use.\n",
